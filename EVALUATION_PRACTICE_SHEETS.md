# ft_transcendence Evaluation Practice Sheets

## ðŸ“‹ **Sheet 1: Backend Knowledge (For Frontend Developer)**

### **Basic Questions (Score: 30 points)**

1. **HTTP Methods** (5 points)
   - Q: What HTTP method should be used to join a tournament?
   - A: POST - because we're creating a new tournament participation record
   - Q: What status code is returned when a tournament is full?
   - A: 400 Bad Request with error message "Tournament is full"

2. **Authentication** (10 points)
   - Q: How does JWT authentication work in this project?
   - A: JWT tokens are generated on login, stored in localStorage, sent in Authorization header as "Bearer <token>", verified by middleware on protected routes
   - Q: What happens when a JWT token expires?
   - A: Server returns 401 Unauthorized, frontend redirects to login page

3. **WebSocket Communication** (15 points)
   - Q: Explain the WebSocket message format for game moves
   - A: `{ type: 'game', event: 'move', data: { direction: 'up' | 'down' } }`
   - Q: How does real-time game state synchronization work?

### **Advanced Questions (Score: 40 points)**

4. **Database Relationships** (15 points)
   - Q: Explain the relationship between tournaments and tournament_matches tables

5. **Tournament Logic** (15 points)
   - Q: How would you implement automatic tournament bracket generation?

6. **Security Measures** (10 points)
   - Q: What prevents cheating in online games?
   - A: Server-side game state validation, move rate limiting, input sanitization, authoritative server model

### **Practical Tasks (Score: 30 points)**

7. **API Testing** (10 points)
   ```bash
   # Create user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'
   
   # Create tournament
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tournaments \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test Tournament","max_participants":8}'
   ```

8. **Database Queries** (10 points)
   ```sql
   -- Get tournament with participant count
   SELECT t.*, COUNT(tp.user_id) as participant_count 
   FROM tournaments t 
   LEFT JOIN tournament_participants tp ON t.id = tp.tournament_id 
   WHERE t.id = 1 
   GROUP BY t.id;
   ```

9. **Friend System** (10 points)
   ```bash
   # Send friend request
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/friends/add/2 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ **Sheet 2: Frontend Knowledge (For Backend Developer)**

### **Basic Questions (Score: 30 points)**

1. **TypeScript SPA Architecture** (10 points)
   - Q: How does the router work without changing the URL?
   - A: Uses History API pushState to update browser history, internal route mapping, manual page loading via fetch and dynamic imports

2. **Tailwind CSS** (10 points)
   - Q: What are the benefits of utility-first CSS?
   - A: Rapid development, consistent design system, small bundle size, no CSS naming conflicts, responsive design built-in

3. **WebSocket Client** (10 points)
   - Q: How does the game page connect to the WebSocket backend?
   - A: GameWebSocketService connects to ws://localhost:3000/ws, sends auth token, handles events with callback system

### **Advanced Questions (Score: 40 points)**

4. **Component Lifecycle** (15 points)
   - Q: Explain how the game rendering system works
   - A: GameRenderer class manages canvas, receives GameState updates via WebSocket, renders at 60fps with requestAnimationFrame, handles state changes

5. **Responsive Design** (15 points)
   - Q: How is mobile responsive design implemented?
   - A: Tailwind breakpoints (md:, lg:), flexible layouts with Flexbox/Grid, mobile-first approach, responsive typography

6. **State Management** (10 points)
   - Q: How is application state managed without frameworks?
   - A: Event-driven architecture, localStorage for auth, WebSocket for real-time state, DOM as view layer, TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### **Practical Tasks (Score: 30 points)**

7. **Navigation Testing** (10 points)
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   router.navigate('tournament');
   router.navigate('game');
   router.navigate('profile-settings');
   ```

8. **Game State Inspection** (10 points)
   ```javascript
   // View WebSocket messages in Network tab
   // Inspect game state updates
   console.log(gameService.getGameState());
   ```

9. **Style Modifications** (10 points)
   ```html
   <!-- Change tournament card colors -->
   <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-purple-600">
   ```
